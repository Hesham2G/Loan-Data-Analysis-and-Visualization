# Loan-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project leverages data analysis and visualization techniques to explore and analyze loan-related data. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy, the project performs comprehensive data analysis on a dataset, including statistical analysis, distribution plots, and category-wise visualizations.

Key features of the project:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and inspects the dataset, checks for missing values, and performs basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates statistical measures like mean, trimmed mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and median absolute deviation (MAD) to understand the loan amounts and other key features in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations such as box plots, histograms, pie charts, and count plots for various numerical and categorical features to highlight trends and distributions.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into the category type for optimized analysis and visualization.
- **Category-Wise Insights**: Plots distributions and summaries for different categorical features like 'loan term' and 'home ownership'.
  
This project helps uncover insights into loan characteristics and trends, such as the relationship between loan amount and income ratios, grade distribution, and home ownership status. Itâ€™s an ideal example for anyone looking to dive into data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization in Python.
